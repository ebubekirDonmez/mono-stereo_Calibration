## üìñ Detailed Description

This stereo camera calibration system provides a complete solution for calibrating dual-camera setups used in computer vision applications. The system uses chessboard patterns to establish precise camera parameters, including intrinsic matrices, distortion coefficients, and stereo geometry.

The calibration process involves capturing multiple stereo image pairs with the chessboard in different positions and orientations. The system automatically detects chessboard corners, refines their positions, and computes camera parameters using OpenCV's proven calibration algorithms.

Key features include real-time corner detection, automatic sample collection, distortion correction, and stereo rectification. The output provides both standard calibration parameters and stereo rectification maps, making it suitable for depth estimation and 3D reconstruction applications.

This solution is particularly useful for industrial applications requiring accurate stereo vision, such as quality control, robotic vision, and automated inspection systems where precise depth perception is critical for operational success.

The system's real-time monitoring capabilities allow users to see the calibration progress and ensure optimal chessboard positioning, resulting in high-quality calibration parameters that are essential for accurate stereo vision applications.
